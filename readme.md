# fluid design 

-Laptop (min-width:1001px)  I used this for laptops because they have large screens, so I can display content side by side, have bigger images, and wider margins without making it look crowded.

-Tablet (601pxâ€“1000px)  I used this for tablets because the screen is smaller than a laptop, so I adjusted the layout to make sure text, images, and columns fit nicely and remain easy to read.

-Mobile (max-width:600px)  I used this for phones because the screen is very small, so all content stacks vertically, text is readable, and buttons or links are easy to tap.


# Color Scheme
-reason i choose these colours is because they go well together as well as that they arent too bright or too dark. They can grab the attention of the person who is viewing it
